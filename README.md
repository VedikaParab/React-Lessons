# Learning React

This repository documents my journey of learning React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Here, I am exploring React concepts, building projects, and experimenting with new features to deepen my understanding.

## Learning Notes

### Creating a React App: CRA vs Vite

There are two common ways to create a React app:

1. **Create React App (CRA):**
    - Uses JavaScript (`.js`) files by default.
    - Slower initial setup and development server start.
    - Includes built-in scripts for building, testing, and ejecting.
    - Generates more boilerplate code.
    - Uses Webpack for bundling.

2. **Vite:**
    - Uses JSX (`.jsx`) files by default.
    - Much faster startup and hot module replacement.
    - Minimal boilerplate, focuses on speed and simplicity.
    - Scripts are not included by default; you configure as needed.
    - Uses native ES modules and modern tooling.

**Note:** When creating React components, always start component names with a capital letter (e.g., `MyComponent`). This is required for React to recognize them as components.
